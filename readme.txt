These two folders contain python code to calculate and analyse frequency
conversion (FC) and parametric down-conversion (PDC )processes as presented in
the corresponding paper.

Required is python 2.x with the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pytables

Each code base resides in its separate folder with detailed instructions on its
applications given in the respective readme.txt files.

It should be noted that the two calculations are extremely similar, hence the
majority of the code is identical, with the exception of some minus signs at
the appropriate places.
